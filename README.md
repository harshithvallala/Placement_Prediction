# Job Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict student job placement outcomes based on their academic performance and other relevant features. The dataset includes student details such as their SSC, Intermediate percentages, as well as gender, subject preferences, and placement status. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a student will be placed in a company.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: The programming language used for data processing, machine learning, and visualization.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
- *Numpy*: For numerical operations and calculations.
- *Scikit-learn*: For implementing machine learning algorithms and performance evaluation.
- *Matplotlib*: For data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- gender: The gender of the student.
- ssc_percentage: The percentage of marks obtained in the SSC examination.
- ssc_board: The board of education in the SSC examination.
- hsc_percentage: The percentage of marks obtained in the HSC examination.
- hsc_board: The board of education in the HSC examination.
- hsc_subject: The major subject studied in the HSC (e.g., Commerce, Science, Arts).
- degree_percentage: The percentage of marks obtained in the undergraduate degree.
- undergrad_degree: The type of undergraduate degree.
- mba_percentage: The percentage of marks obtained in the MBA degree.
- status: The placement status (whether the student was placed or not).

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-placement-prediction.git
cd job-placement-prediction


# Then, install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# The requirements.txt file includes all the Python libraries used in the project.

## How to Use

1. *Data Loading*  
   The dataset can be loaded from a CSV file using pandas.read_csv(). The code reads the data and prints it out for inspection.

2. *Data Preprocessing*  
   The dataset is preprocessed to clean and transform the data. Missing values and irrelevant features are handled, and necessary feature engineering steps are performed.

3. *Model Building*  
   Multiple machine learning models are implemented:
   - *Logistic Regression*
   - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
   - *Support Vector Classifier (SVC)*
   - *Decision Trees*
   - *Naive Bayes*

   These models are trained using the training data and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

4. *Evaluation*  
   The model performance is evaluated and visualized using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and other relevant metrics to choose the best-performing model.

5. *Prediction*  
   Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict placement outcomes for new student data.

## Example

python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Job_Placement_Data.csv')

# Preprocess and prepare data (e.g., cleaning, feature engineering)
# ...

# Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('status', axis=1)
y = data['status']

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print(f"Confusion Matrix: \n{confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)}")


## Results
The project evaluates the performance of different machine learning models, and the evaluation metrics are compared to determine the most accurate model for predicting job placements.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting job placements based on various student metrics. By applying different algorithms and comparing their performance, we can gain insights into the most influential factors for placement success.
